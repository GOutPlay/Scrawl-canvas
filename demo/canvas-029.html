    <h4>Test purpose</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a linear gradient</li>
      <li>Create several Phrase objects</li>
      <li>Position some with relative coordinates</li>
      <li>Create a Shape entity and position one of the phrases on it with 'path' (delta animated)</li>
      <li>Check that the gradient appears as expected when it is vertical (top-bottom)</li>
      <li>Check that the gradient appears as expected when it is horizontal (left-right)</li>
      <li>Check that the gradient appears as expected for both cell-locked and entity-locked gradients</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>May 2020 results</h4> 
    <p>Currently experiencing a number of issues and bugs in the mix between phrase and styles code:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Cell-locked vertical gradients (seem to) appear as expected.</li>
      <li>Cell-locked horizontal gradients - the initial letter's gradient appears to be mis-positioned, compared to the other letters in the Phrase.</li>
      <li>... For multi-line Phrases this also applies to a few other letters in the text.</li>
      <li>Entity-locked gradients do not display (they are either set to 0 or 999) - this almost certainly has something to do with Phrase height issues.</li>
      <li>Phrases locked to a path - all letters appear to use the initial letter's take on the gradient it should be displaying.</li>
      <li>... This is a very nice effect with horizontal gradients!</li>
    </ul>
