    <h4>Test purpose</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Setup a radial gradient which includes a delta object to manipulate its palette's start end end cursor</li>
      <li>Setup a block entity to display the gradient</li>
      <li>During the animation, the center of the gradient should gradually change color as each hoop builds and wanes (in Scrawl-canvas versions prior to v8 this would jump between black and the full color as each color stop moved away from position 0)</li>
      <li>During the animation, the color beyond the outer radius should gradually change color as each hoop builds and wanes (in Scrawl-canvas versions prior to v8 this would jump between black and the full color as each color stop moved towards position 1)</li>
    </ul>
