# SCRAWL-CANVAS Library 

Version 8.0.0 (alpha) - 25 June 2019

Scrawl-canvas is  JavaScript library which adds an API for handling and manipulating HTML5 &lt;canvas> elements in the DOM.

Developed by Rik Roots: rik.roots@rikworks.co.uk

Scrawl-canvas website: http://scrawl.rikweb.org.uk (currently running on Scrawl-canvas v6)


## NOTES for V8-alpha: 

Recoded from scratch! Modular code pattern with import/export - no need to worry about loading js files anymore

No longer supports IE browsers. Edge support will hopefully come back online later in 2019 once MS releases the new blink/v8 build


### ROADMAP - Summer 2019:

1. Tabbing through portions of the canvas display
* decide whether it's worth the effort (eg if there's more than one anchor in the canvas)
* if yes, how to achieve it?

2. Analytics
* should be able to plug in eg Google Analytics using existing functionality such as tween actions, canvas.cascadeEventAction, etc
* see what else could be added? Is there a need to centralize/coordinate reporting, or can that be left to the user?

3. Text manipulation
* is there a need for users to be able to copy/paste text from/to Phrase entitys? If yes, how to do it?
* also an opportunity to consider how best to expose Phrase text to the DOM beyond the canvas

4. Review processes for dismantling/deleting everything 
* make sure they work
* make sure it happens cleanly
* minimize/eliminate as much leakage as possible
* also an opportunity to review code/demos for more general memory leaks, efficiency, etc

5. Canvas dynamic generation (adding to page and/or stack), canvas cloning
* code up demo DOM-012 to test functionality
* also need to make sure we're making good use of current canvas/group stuff

6. Generate Images and/or Picture entitys from other entitys, groups, cells, etc
* at the same time think about colour detection? Though bit of an edge case, tbh

7. Animated sprites
* to replicate and improve on existing functionality in v7
* maybe see if we can make using sprites similar to using videos?
* consider usefulness of running sprites using existing tween/ticker/action stuff?
* great if we can find a way to easily import and use various spritesheet+manifest bundles generated by 3rd parties

8. Save/Restore functionality 
* in a way that will allow 3rd parties to develop and share stuff easily
* CRITICAL to get this right - can become a USP for the library
* also start thinking about how best to export stuff in a way that makes importing it into React/Vue/etc dead easy

9. I want to add in some simple-to-use zoom and (parallax) scrolling capability
* because v7 can do this and I don't want to lose it

10. Develop Frame artefact
* this is the four-corners approach used in v7 Frames
* but this time make it even better!

11. Develop Loom artefact
* using 2 Shape objects as left/right or top/bottom paths to allow for more interesting/malleable Frame-like visual fx

12. Develop Net artefact
* effectively grouping a bunch of Frames together, sharing a single asset, batch-processing the output
* this is gonna be a helluva lot quicker when we can finally use Canvas elements in web workers - thus can delay this work until later 2019 or after

13. Think about developing a Grid artefact (eg for demos DOM-013, Canvas-019)
* because the current solution is painfully slow once we get a lot of entity tiles onto the canvas

14. Physics engine
* because it's in v7 and I don't wanna lose it
* though tbh it isn't that important
* one (different) approach might be to add to the 'delta animation' functionality already built in?
* having particles and springs would make the Net artefact a lot more interesting eg v7 physics net demo 

15. Displacement map filter-like functionality
* just for the challenge of it

16. Work out how to get and use SVG into the system as assets which can be used by Picture/Pattern etc
* annoying that we can't use raw SVG in the same way we can use <img> <video> <canvas> as source assets
* same situation for <picture> - why can't we just use them as a source asset?


### Roadmap - further ahead:

* Look at using HTMLImageElement.decode() method - promise-based! - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/decode

* Want to make use of Offscreen Canvases where possible - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas (currently only Chrome/Opera)
